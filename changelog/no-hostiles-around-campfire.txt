https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/no-hostiles-around-campfire

=========
v2.4: Improved distance calculations for entities around the campfire. Both to prevent spawn and when they should burn on placement. Should work as intended now.
Moved code to check for passengers from the collective library mod to no hostiles around campfire.

=========
v2.3: Improved code efficiency.
Switched dependency from FAB Library to the Collective library mod.

Campfires are now instantly detected when placed.
