Changelog:
Nether Portal Spread
https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/nether-portal-spread

=========
4.0: The mod has been almost completely rewritten. It now saves portal locations in ./world-folder/data/netherportalspread/portals/, and detects portals when a player creates one or when someone goes through an inactive portal from the nether to the overworld. This makes the mod a lot more efficient.
The spread code now runs entirely on the main thread, solving incompatibility problems with other mods which caused crashes.
Added option (enabled by default) which displays portal coordinates in portal messages.
Added a new default config for Minecraft version 1.16, which uses a lot of the new blocks.

=========
v3.5: Improved backend code.
Added configurable message to broadcast to players within the radius when a portal is broken.
