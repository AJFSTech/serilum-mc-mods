Other changes:
The Looting enchant now has an effect on the head drop chance. This can be enabled/disabled within the config file. The chance is 3.5% at level I, 4.5% at level II, and 5.5% at level III and so forth. It also works on looting levels higher than 3.

There is a seperate drop chance for all three, which is active if the specific drop chances have been enabled.
